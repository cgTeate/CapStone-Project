		Running the website
----------------------------------------------------------

Running the Database Script
--------------------------------------

1. Creating the Database
	-If not already installed, download and set up SQL Server 2017 
		Management Studio
	-Open SQL Server Management Studio
	-Connect with Windows Authentication
	-Open the Capstone.sql file and execute.



Setting up the Database/Network: 
--------------------------------------

1. Configure SQL Server Express 
	-Open SQL Server Management Studio
	-In Object Explorer, right-click a server and select Properties.
	-Click the Connections node.
	-Under Remote server connections, select the Allow remote
	 connections to this server check box.
2. Configure SQL Server Configuration Manager
	-Open SQL Server Configuration Manager
	-In the Sql Server Network Configuration, right click on TCP/IP and enable it.
	-To open one port for this connection, Right click on TCP/IP and click Properties
	-Under the IP Addresses tab, Set the TCP Port to 49171 under the APAII tab.
	-Reset the SQL Server Manager.
3. Configure Windows Firewall For Port Connection
	-Open Windows Firewall, and go to Advance Settings
	-Under the Actions tab on the left side, Click New Rule...
	- Set the Rule Type to Port, TCP for Protocol and Ports and type in 49171 for the Specific local ports
	-Allow the Connection, then leave Domain, Private, and Public checked.
	-Then name the rule "SQL TCP Connection" or something similar and click Finish.
4. Connecting to the Database from a different Computer
	-Open SQL Server Management Studio
	-Click on Connect
	-Type in the IP Address and the Port Number in this format - xxx.xxx.xx.x, 49171
	-Then Connect

Running the Project on VSCode:
--------------------------------------
1. Download and Install
	-If you do not already have a copy, download and install Netbeans IDE 8.2.

2. Loading the file to the Projects tab
	-Click Open Project under the File tab and Load in TheCartel file.

3. Getting the Jars/Libraries Correct 
	-Right click on the Project and click Properties
	-Under Libraries, check if the sqldbc42, mail, and activation jar files exist among the 
		Compile-time Libraries then press OK.
	-If it doesn't exist, then click Add JAR/Folder and add the three jar files.
		You should find the jar files in the Program folder under the Jar 
		Files directory.
4. Altering IP Addresses
	-If running in localhost/same computer, the project should work fine and no changes
		are needed in the classes.
	-If the server is running in a separate computer from the client (highly recommended!),
		then change "localhost" to the IP Address of the server in the following lines:
		> LoginPanel.java 	at line 61
		> Register.java 	at line 127
		> ResetPassPanel.java 	at line 181
		
Running the game
--------------------------------------
1. Run the AuthorizationServer and PrimaryServer first.

2. Run the game by clicking on the green run arrow on the top of Netbeans
	or by right-clicking StartFrame and hitting Run File.

Warning!
--------------------------------------
1. Shutting down either backend server or docker containers while clients are using it/connected to it can cause 
	severe errors. Avoid doing so, if at all posible.
