                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">How do I sell on Hype Heads?</h1>
                <p>Hype Heads is a marketplace where Buyers and Sellers can make anonymous offers on a wide variety of current culture items such as sneakers, streetwear, electronics and collectibles, based both on the item's current valuation on the site, but also how much you're willing to sell it for. Hype Heads's anonymous nature aims to make buying and selling a hassle-free experience: Buyers see the lowest available sale price, and Sellers see the highest available buying offer.</p>
                <p>Since both Buyers and Sellers can set their respective offers, a sale on Hype Heads doesn’t begin until a Seller and a Buyer agree on a price through a Buyer's Bid matching a Seller's Ask or vice versa. You as a Seller have two ways to match with a Buyer on Hype Heads, through utilizing the “Sell Now” and “Ask” features.</p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">When can I expect to receive my item?</h1>
                <p>Hype Heads strives to deliver your item to you within 7-12 business days. Although this may be slightly longer than you are used to, since the Hype Heads marketplace deals with high value and rare products, we want to ensure that the items you purchase on our site meet our internal quality standards. </p>
                <p>As such, the Hype Heads shipping time frame for Buyers takes into account the time it takes for the Seller to ship the item to us, and the time we spend verifying the item at our facilities. This is to ensure that every item that gets into the hands of a Buyer is one they'll be confident displaying or wearing.</p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">Can I return my item after I've received it?</h1>
                <p>Due to the anonymous nature of our live market, we are unable to offer returns, exchanges or swaps—including if you ordered the wrong size. The good news is you can always resell with us if you no longer want your item. </p>
                <p>Please note, if you are an EU/UK resident and would like to exercise your right of withdrawal, you can find more information in the following FAQ: What does the Right of Withdrawal mean for EU/UK customers?</p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">Can I change my shipping address after my purchase is confirmed?</h1>
                <p>Up to a point, you are able to change your shipping address once your purchase is confirmed. </p>
                <p>The easiest way to ensure your item goes to the correct address is to verify your shipping address is correct before purchasing an item. Any purchases you make on Hype Heads will use the address we have on file. </p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">How much does shipping cost for Buyers?</h1>
                <p>Shipping fees vary based on a variety of factors including the price of the item, size of the item, item type, shipping costs determined by our carrier partners, and the shipping destination of the Buyer. Buyers will always see the entire shipping cost prior to placing a Bid, or purchasing an item.</p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">How much does shipping cost for Sellers?</h1>
                <p>As a Seller, your shipping cost is deducted from your total payout. </p>
                <p>Once a transaction is complete, you will receive a shipping label in your “My Account” section of the site. You are responsible for packaging and dropping off with the shipping carrier on the label provided to you. After the product arrives and our team of experts verify the item and condition, your payout will be released. </p>
                <p>Heavier items? We adjust the shipping costs when necessary for heavier items and multi-item packs. So, still use the label we provide even if the weight is incorrect on the label.</p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">What payment methods are accepted for NFTs?</h1>
                <p>Currently, you can purchase NFTs with a credit card, debit card, or PayPal. </p>
                <p>Cryptocurrencies are not an acceptable payment method for NFTs at this time, but the team is working hard to enable crypto payments in the future. Stay tuned.</p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">Can I return or cancel an NFT purchase or sale?</h1>
                <p>All NFT transactions are final; there are no returns or cancellations. However, you can always sell an NFT to the highest bidder or place an Ask at a price of your choosing.</p>
                <h1 className="text-2xl text-left my-6 font-semibold">What is an NFT?</h1>
                <p>A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a unique, non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain. NFTs can link to and/or represent digital files, including but not limited to art, photos, videos, gifs, audio, as unique entities on the blockchain. NFTs can also connect to physical items. When someone purchases an NFT, the digital or physical asset is replaced with a digital token recorded as a unique entity on the blockchain. NFT tokens are also assigned a unique identifier to function as a title of ownership and authenticity of said digital content or physical item. </p>
